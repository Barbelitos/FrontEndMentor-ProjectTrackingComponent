## My process

### Built with

- HTML5

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was a good practice of flexbox, both in navigation and main containers. Also had to do some research about how to properly hide overflow content in the page.

### Continued development

Continuing to improve my CSS skills, especially flexbox.
